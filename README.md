A beginner-friendly project that helps Oracle DBAs and data professionals build an end-to-end ML pipeline, from Oracle DB extraction to model training using Python and scikit-learn.

# Oracle to ML Data Pipeline

A step-by-step project that helps Oracle DBAs transition into ML workflows using Python.

Objective
============

This project shows how to:
- Connect to Oracle and extract tabular data
- Clean and transform it for ML
- Train a basic ML model using the Oracle data

Structure
==============
1) notebooks/ – Jupyter notebooks for each stage (extract, transform, train)
2) utils/ – Oracle DB connection helper
3) data/ – Sample exports (for offline experimentation)


Tech Stack
===========

1) Python, Pandas, cx_Oracle or SQLAlchemy
2) Scikit-learn (for ML model)
3) Jupyter Notebooks
